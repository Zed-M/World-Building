Thanks to the Archmage Abraxas Ocixus is a city between Nightmares and Daydreams. It was created during the downfall of Ocixus, the syndicate's original world. Abraxas removed the ruins of a once flourishing city from the world, moving it to a place within the Moon's Realm where dreams nor nightmares could reach. The city was given it's name after the downfall of the world.

Within Ocixus lies The Syndicate named [NAME2]. The Syndicate's main function is to watch and maintain the City of Ocixus. In the city they work on understanding the functions of Dreams and Nightmares. Anyone who aligns under the same goals of The Syndicate is allowed within the City of Ocixus. Which is the following:
- Anyone with the goal to study the following: Dreams, Nightmares, Worlds themselves, and etc.
- Anyone who wishes to travel between the connected worlds.

The city focuses on studying the world around it; however, holds the rule of never studying Earth apart from the knowledge already known. The Watcher of The Moon noticed the fractured off land during a mishaps, and informed the Syndicate that it can stay where it is. As long as the research that is being done is not research towards Earth. While some members of the Syndicate wished to research more about the other half of existence, they agreed and banned the advancement of knowledge of Earth.
